## Insight & Recommendation
### Insight

Both sales and profit have grown steadily over the years, with a noticeable increase in recent years. This shows an overall positive trend, potentially due to expanding markets or product demand.
#### Market Analysis
- The APAC region contributes the highest profit, followed by the EU and the US. These three regions account for a significant portion of overall profits, with APAC leading at 30%.
- EMEA, Canada, and Africa show lower profit contributions, indicating potential for improvement or that these markets are currently underutilized.
#### Category Analysis
Technology products are the largest profit contributor (61%), followed by Office Supplies (20%) and Furniture (19%). This suggests that technology products are highly profitable and may have a strong demand.
#### Segment Analysis
The Consumer segment contributes the highest profit (52%), followed by Corporate (30%) and Home Office (18%). This indicates that the Consumer segment is the primary market focus, which could guide future marketing and sales strategies.
#### Top Performing Regions, Countries, and Sub-Categories
