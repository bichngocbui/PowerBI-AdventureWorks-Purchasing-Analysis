This project involves creating a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard for a global retail company called Superstore. The dashboard aims to provide senior management with actionable insights for market expansion strategies and strategic product selection.
## Bussiness Context 
The company operates in a competitive global market, requiring strategic insight into regional performance and product success to maintain and expand its market position. With increasing demands for efficiency and profitability, senior management needs a clear, data-driven understanding of which markets and products drive the most value and where there may be operational challenges.
